			`	Your eyes widen a bit in shock, still saluting. "Lieutenant?"`
			`	"Per High Command's recommendation," he states while making a slight bounce on the tips of his feet, smiling. "And I can see they made the right choice. The speed and skill with which your ship, the <ship>, destroyed that Raven proves you are both serious about joining the Navy...and it's ready for battle."`

At ease."`

			`	Stepping out of your ship, fully-dressed, you make your way to the spaceport. The walk is uneventful, for the most part, but every now and again, some of the locals slightly turn to look at you. Given the current climate, you can't tell if it's because they're looks of awe or suspicion - you decide to settle on the former.`

			`You meet with Admiral Danforth in a modestly-sized conference room. There are many others who have enlisted sitting around you. "Welcome to Navy services," Danforth says. "There's a lot you'll be learning, but let me start with one of the most important things first: Navy Ships are expensive."`
			`There's a few chuckles from the seated enlisted, but stern looks from both Danforth and their peers quickly quiets them down.`

"With all the ships we lost in the nuclear attack, we simply can NOT afford to lose more ships. Each of you will report to the base on <destination> for your first assignment. Any questions?"`

			`Right as Cruz narrates, the unknown ships open fire on the Syndicate fleet with their weapons, and reduce the Syndicate ships to little more than drifting hulks. And as swiftly as they appeared, the unknown ships vanish, and the feed goes dead.`
			``
			`	"This is where things get troubling. As soon as the unknown fleet left, the hyperlanes to several Syndicate systems just...disappeared along with them. It's like the systems never even existed in the first place."`
			``
			`You do your best to process all that just happened, but it's impossible. First, the Syndicate sends a fleet of nuclear-capable warships to Earth with the (likely) intent to demand Parliament gives complete control over to the Syndicate. Then an alien race unlike any you've seen before suddenly materializes and annihilates the Syndicate ships. Now, Cruz says that the ability to travel to Syndicate worlds has been blocked? At this point, you wouldn't be surprised if Cruz went on to mention that pigs can fly and dragons are real.`
			``
			`Rather than potentially go insane trying to make sense of it all, you refocus on the here and now and ask:`
			`	"What are my orders, Commodore?"`
			`"First, High Command needs you to report back to Luna - a Syndicate ambassador will be present to meet and accompany you to Syndicate space. You are to then investigate the systems near those severed from the known hyperlanes, and see if a 'backdoor' to the lost systems exists - possibly through the uninhabited systems to the galactic north of Syndicate space. I would give you more information, Captain <last>, but none exists. For now, report back to Luna and meet with the ambassador - we'll discuss our next move after a meeting with the Syndicate."`

#### I should note that this is just the edited dialogue from Michael Zahniser's "FW Pug 2B" mission from the reconciliation branch. (because this was too hard for me to write and supposed to have the exact same outcome)
			`As you are coming in for a landing you announce yourself to the spaceport authorities as diplomatic representatives of the Republic. The moment you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you to their headquarters, culminating with the arrival at the extravagantly-furnished (perhaps even disgustingly-so) office of Alastair Korban - the CEO of the entire Syndicate Corporation.`
			`"I'm very glad you've come," says Alastair. "It seems unlikely that we can defeat this attack unless we work together."`
			`	"Wait," John says, "you're saying this whole thing is not the Syndicate's doing?"`
			`	Alastair seems taken aback. "Of course not. Seal off valuable trade routes? Why would we do that?"`
			choice
				`	"We thought you were walling yourselves off to escape prosecution for putting a nuke fleet in orbit around Earth!"`
				`	"If it isn't you, then who is it?"`
					goto who
			
			`	Alastair says, "That terrorism was the action of a certain extremist faction that we have since purged from our ranks, and we were in the process of hunting down the perpetrators."`
			choice
				`	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
				`	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
					goto who
			
			`	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
			label who
			`	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
			`	"How do you know this?" asks John.`
			`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"Did it not occur to you that attacking the Korath might anger other alien species?"`
					goto anger
				`	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`
					goto convoluted

			`	"That is unlikely. The equipment we stole from the Korath is most likely something they stole from someone else."`
				goto help

				goto help
			
			label help
			`	"Assuming you're telling the truth," you say, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
			`	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
			choice
				`	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
					goto deal
			label deal
			`	"Hold on," John says, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`

All that we ask in return is a portion of the goods your worlds produce, to help offset the cost of watching over and protecting so many human worlds.

However, there's one last hurdle to conquer before victory can be claimed at last. How fitting, you muse to yourself, that the beginning of the end takes place here...on Geminus.`
			`	The commanding officers are seated around a large meeting table as you enter the room.

			`	Near your arrival point, a small podium has been set up for your final briefing. As you step up to the microphone, some feedback squawks through the speakers, to which an audio tech quickly remedies. Once the feedback is dealt with, you bark: "All crews, fallll IN!"`
			`	Immediately, all officers and enlisted stop what they're doing and form ranks in front of the podium. The whole experience feels like something out of a movie as you begin the briefing, your voice echoing throughout the hangar...`
			`	"This is it, ladies and gentlemen - the complete and total surrender of the Syndicate is all but inevitable. Only a few desperate holdouts remain, and it comes down to us to finalize our victory."`
			`	You turn to your right and slowly begin to pace back and forth in front of the officers and their crews. "We know what's at stake here. To fail now would be a fatal blow for the Republic - not just for morale, but for our people. Our united citizens, Republic and Free Worlds, alike, are looking to us for guidance...and for hope. Hope that we will see another tomorrow. Hope that we will rise from the ashes of this war far stronger than when we started. And hope that we can finally rest, peacefully, safe from all that would seek to destroy that which we value above all else: our freedom."`
			`	"I won't sugar-coat any of this - it's quite possible that when we come back to this hangar, there may be some faces and ships absent. The average citizen in the Republic, never mind the Free Worlds, may never even know of your existence."`

			`	"But the enemy...the enemy will know. Through our courage and tenacity, we will forever carve an image of ourselves into the hearts and minds of the enemy. We will burn so bright that when even the last lights in the Universe wink out of existence, the enemy will still know of our actions, and never forget the scars of our heroism they experienced. And with this knowledge, we board our ships knowing that defeat is impossible for us, men - we have already claimed victory!"`
