			`As you begin your landing approach, you recieve a message from the control tower, directing you to a private landing pad about two miles from the main spaceport. You land at the pad and are greeted by three scientists in white lab coats. They introduce themselves as Amy, John, and Peter. As the mechanic refuels your ship, you follow the scientists to a shuttle waiting nearby. You take a seat, flanked by John, while the more reserved Peter sits with his wife, Amy. John instantly begins to chatter about their new weapon, the Electron Beam. He tells you that it is far more advanced than any other beam weapon the Deep has ever created. The shuttle starts moving, and John continues to tell you everything about the beam, but you eventually lose focus. The shuttle stops, and you all climb out. As you gaze at the decrepit warehouse before you, you wonder if the shuttle took you to the wrong place.`

				`	Wow, you certainly chose an odd place to work from. Does this facility even work?`
			`Amy laughs. "No, this is not it. This is just our cover, we can't have the public knowing about a secret weapons facility! I mean, who would expect this to be what it is?"`

			`John replies, "Most assuredly, my friend. After all, we mustn't have the public knowing about a secret weapons facility!"`

			`You follow the scientists inside, where there is a well-lit elevator. John puts a code into a keypad, which opens the elevatot doors. You walk in and it begins its descent. You all step into a sleek lab, filled with scientists. John leads you down a path to a sealed room. He motions to Peter, and they both pull out a card and they swipe them simultaneously. The door opens with a hiss and reveals a perfectly white room, and a table on which is seated a new weapon, which you guess is the electron beam. 
			`John motions you over, saying, "Here it is! Twenty tons of pure destruction. But there is one problem. Because of increased pirate problems in Syndicate space, we are missing some crucial materials. We need you to get those materials before we can get this working. Your destination is Lodestone, in the Ankaa system. We have some fun for you when you get back," he says with a wink. You nod assent, even though you are still enamoured by this elegant weapon, and John ushers you back to your ship.`

		conversation `You land on Lodestone and find the shipment ready to go. You finish filing the order with the dock master, but as you turn back to your ship in the distance, you realize something is wrong: it is surrounded by ships painted red, and there are dozens of men walking in and out of your ship, carrying what you realize with dread is your cargo. You scream at the dock master to get ships in the air, but the pirates see them coming. The last of the men run into their ships and they bolt into the atmosphere, where you see the ominous silhouette of a Bactrian waiting for you, guns pulsing with energy. You dash into your ship, expecting it to be stripped of everything, but surprisingly everything is untouched, except for the cargo hold, where you find the doors busted open and the tracks of a mobile truck running across the threshold. You quickly dash into the cockpit and radio control tower for permission to depart. Within seconds you have gained priority access and are shooting out of the atmosphere. Now it is up to you to face the pirate fleet, and take back the cargo that is now aboard the bactrian. (Remember, do not destroy the bactrian until you have taken all the cargo from it!)`
